		<p class="text">A student is walking leisurely to her classroom, enjoying her coffee and scrolling through her phone. She's in no rush, as she believes she has plenty of time to make it to her lecture. Suddenly, the student looks up at the clock and realizes that she's already five minutes late. She starts to run down the hallway, but spills her coffee all over herself in the process. She's now in a hurry, but also covered in coffee.</p>

		<p class="text">The student finally makes it to her classroom, completely flustered and embarrassed. However, her professor is understanding and simply asks if she's okay.
