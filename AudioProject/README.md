# Fear in the Skies: A Flight Emergency


# Project Description
For this project, our group decided to create a soundscape called “Fear in the Skies: A Flight Emergency” that narrates the story of a flight emergency. The storyline revolves around a specific aircraft that is on a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York and on the way the aircraft and passengers experience severe turbulence. The soundscape mimics the ambiance and atmosphere of the plane prior to and after the turbulence as well as the passenger's reactions. To create our soundscape, we followed the principles we learned in class to structure the storyline, which consists of a beginning, middle, and end. The story begins in the airport at the boarding gate with the boarding announcements and continues with the plane taking off. Then announcements of turbulence are made by the captain and passengers begin to panic. The story concludes with the captain making an emergency landing at the nearest airport that would welcome them. The main idea behind this storyline and soundscape is to portray a flight emergency and show the dread, terror, and relief that passengers feel in such circumstances. The theme we attempt to portray in the storyline is survival and how people can overcome obstacles in such situations. The experience we were striving to create is an immersive and engaging one where we try and take the listener on a journey through sound. We wanted the user to feel as if they were there experiencing the emotions and sensations of the passengers on the plane.


# Process
When receiving this project, as a group we decided what type of audio to create, which was a soundscape with a story, we began brainstorming and coming up with potential themes to explore. Throughout the process, we settled on coming up with a storyline of a flight emergency. As there is a lot of room for creativity, we thought it would be fun to compose the soundscape. We made the [outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p7RGG4lCS3AO9NT0rOVlpavfN1pizXM1iB2zlMAE05k/edit?usp=sharing) of the soundscape and the potential sound effects to use. In our outline and script, we specified the types of sounds we wanted to include that would reflect and correspond with the storyline. Once we had a detailed outline of our audio we decided on what original sound effects we would produce ourselves. In total, in our soundscape, we incorporated seven original sound effects.  The original sound effects we decided to create were first the boarding announcement, multiple captain announcements, and flight attendant announcements. The reason we decided to produce these originally is to make sure we have consistency with the individuals in the story/soundscape. The other original sounds we created were female passengers talking on the phone, other passengers’ screams, and panic. We decided to add a female passenger who was talking on the phone to her parents to give the story more depth. After deciding on the sounds to create as a group, each member was assigned a role in order to produce these sound effects. Then, we wrote a script for all the announcements and sound effects being produced. This script is shown in the outline [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p7RGG4lCS3AO9NT0rOVlpavfN1pizXM1iB2zlMAE05k/edit?usp=sharing).  

Original Recording's Roles:

## Audio Creation


### Recording Sound Effects

The first step we did before beginning the soundscape was to book the sound equipment from the equipment center on campus. We believe it was essential to use this equipment as it helped us create clean and clear sounds. Once everyone recorded their audio we imported the files to a computer to begin editing and adding other sound effects. As recommended by the Professor and equipment manager we checked out the following: 

-  1x Zoom H4 Recorder

-  1x SD 8GB or 16GB

-  2x AA Rechargeable Batteries

-  1x La Crosse AA Charger

-  1x Universal Plug Adapter

- 1x Headphones

-  1x Mini-USB cable (for getting files off Zoom H4)

### Editing Sound Effects

The original sounds we created needed to be edited in order to fit within the context of our audio story. For example, the boarding announcement needed to sound like it was coming out of a speaker just like how it would be in airports. Therefore, we decided to use iMovie to edit each original sound separately. To create a distorted effect on the sounds we used effects such as echo, muffled, delay, static, and even a telephone effect for the sound of the girl talking on the phone. We used multiple effects on a single audio. In this way, we were able to enhance the sounds that we had recorded and fit them more smoothly into the soundscape story that we had envisioned.

We then decided to use Audacity to create the full soundscape as it provided a wide range of properties to edit sound effects. Before editing the sound effects and adding them to Audacity to combine them together and create smooth transitions we looked through the internet for free non-copyright sound effects to use along with our original sounds. Some sound effects we found and used were the plane take-off and landing.  After gathering sound effects that go along with our storyline, we followed our plot to compose the sounds together. The beginning of the plot was at the airport so we added the boarding announcement first with an airport ambiance sound to depict the plot well. The plot continues to the plane itself where we use an engine sound that we blur like it's in the background and the sound of the girl talking to her parents on the phone. After we added the plane take-off sound followed by silence but still sounds of people sleeping and talking to inform the listener that everyone is calm and relaxed. Then we incorporate the sound effects of shaking and engine crackling sound that increases. We edited the sound so that its volume goes from lower to higher to make the listener feel like there is something dangerous happening. With these sounds, we add the captain turbulence announcement. To make the listener feel the turbulence and sense of danger that is going on we increased the sound of shaking and added the sound of people panicking. We then incorporated the screams produced by Rose. We edited the screams using echos and large room effects that made it seems like they were in the background. We overlaid the other scream sound and increased the sound to make it feel like the girl is screaming next to you. The ending of the plot was the captain making the emergency landing announcement, the landing sound, the sound of relief, clapping, and the girl calling her parents. 


Some of the editing properties we used frequently on Audacity were fade-in, fade-out, manipulating pitch, speed, chopping audio, and looping audio. We mainly used fade-in and fade-out to balance, merge, and smoothly transition between the multiple tracks we had (10 tracks). We used the changing pitch feature to make certain sounds less sharp and more clear for the listener. We used this mainly for the scream sounds. We used the speed feature to make some sounds slower, such as the airplane ambiance sound. Manipulating audio was a technique we used to make certain sounds fit better with the soundscape. For instance, we used two different audios, cut them into parts, and merged them together in order to sound like it was a plane landing. With a combination of all these effects, our goal was to create a consistent well-constructed soundscape. 


## Website Creation

Creating a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was an exhilarating experience for our group. The website we designed was centered around an aircraft's emergency landing, and we chose a plane on a runway as the theme. The website's design aesthetic was clean, modern, and sleek, with interactive features such as a flipping title and a hamburger dropdown menu effect.

One of the most challenging aspects of creating the website was designing the animations and interactions. For instance, we had to use different animations from w3schools to achieve the desired fading in of text when the page loaded. Additionally, we had to figure out how to animate the various sections in the menu list to ensure that they were both functional and visually appealing.

As we worked on the website, we found ourselves learning a lot about web design and development. We discovered that attention to detail was crucial in creating a seamless and visually pleasing user experience. We also realized the importance of planning and testing every aspect of the website to ensure that it worked correctly.

Lastly, creating the aircraft emergency landing website was a fulfilling experience for our group. It allowed us to showcase our skills and creativity while also learning new concepts and techniques. We are proud of the final product and look forward to continuing to improve our web design and development skills as a team.

## Video Creation

To create the video, we combined certain clips of real flights going through heavy turbulence, as well as taking off and landing, and managed to cut them up in a way that synced with our audio. The challenge was to find clips that were consistent throughout the whole vid, as well as ones that conveyed the emergency that the plane in our audio was going through. We wanted to have a visual representation of our audio creation to make the story feel more engaging and almost like a short film or story. We wanted to make the clips show enough to imply what was going on in the audio, without taking away from the audio's main impact on the listener.

# Reflection/Evaluation
This project had various stages in the process of creation starting from brainstorming, storyline creation, and script to finding sound effects, recording sounds, editing sounds together to fit the theme, and website creation to depict the story of the soundscape. We started with creating the soundscape which helped us reach our final outcome. Listening to sound effects and recording them helped us design the website effectively and efficiently in the best way to represent the soundscape. Our expectations and goals were met, and we were able to execute the soundscape we had in mind as well as the vision of our website to correspond with and host our soundscape.
